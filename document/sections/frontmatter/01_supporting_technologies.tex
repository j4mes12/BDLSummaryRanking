This chapter should describe the project context, and motivate each of
the proposed aims and objectives.  Ideally, it is written at a fairly 
high-level, and easily understood by a reader who is technically 
competent but not an expert in the topic itself.

In short, the goal is to answer three questions for the reader.  First, 
what is the project topic, or problem being investigated?  Second, why 
is the topic important, or rather why should the reader care about it?  
For example, why there is a need for this project, who will benefit from the 
project and in what way (e.g., clients/end-users who needed some analysis
done, or other data scientists who might need the tools you have developed), what 
work does the project build on and why is the selected approach either
important and/or interesting (e.g., fills a gap in literature, applies
results from another field to a new problem).  Finally, what are the 
central challenges involved and why are they significant? 
 
The chapter should conclude with a concise bullet point list that 
summarises the aims, objectives, {\bf and achievements}\/ of your work.
