{\bf A topic-specific chapter, roughly 30\% of the total page-count}
\vspace{1cm} 

\noindent
This chapter is intended to describe what you did: the goal is to explain
the main activity or activities, of any type, which constituted your work 
during the project.  The content is highly topic-specific. For some 
projects it will make sense to split the content into two main sections, or maybe even into two separate chapters: one 
will discuss the design of something, including any rationale or decisions made, 
and the other will discuss how this design was realised via some form of 
implementation.  You could instead give this chapter the title ``Design and Implementation"; or you might split this content into two chapters, one titled ``Design" and the other ``Implementation" .

Note that it is common to include evidence of ``best practice'' project 
management (e.g., use of version control, choice of programming language 
and so on).  Rather than simply a rote list, make sure any such content 
is useful and/or informative in some way: for example, if there was a 
decision to be made then explain the trade-offs and implications 
involved.
