% The document class supplies options to control rendering of some standard
% features in the result.  The goal is for uniform style, so some attention 
% to detail is *vital* with all fields.  Each field (i.e., text inside the
% curly braces below, so the MEng text inside {MEng} for instance) should 
% take into account the following:
%
% - author name       should be formatted as "FirstName LastName"
%   (not "Initial LastName" for example),
% - supervisor name   should be formatted as "Title FirstName LastName"
%   (where Title is "Dr." or "Prof." for example),
% - degree programme  should be "BSc", "MEng", "MSci", "MSc" or "PhD",
% - dissertation title should be correctly capitalised (plus you can have
%   an optional sub-title if appropriate, or leave this field blank),
% - dissertation type should be formatted as one of the following:
%   * for the MEng degree programme either "enterprise" or "research" to
%     reflect the stream,
%   * for the MSc  degree programme "$X/Y/Z$" for a project deemed to be
%     X%, Y% and Z% of type I, II and III.
% - year              should be formatted as a 4-digit year of submission
%   (so 2014 rather than the academic year, say 2013/14 say).

	% This macro creates the standard UoB title page by using information drawn
	% from the document class (meaning it is vital you select the correct degree 
	% title and so on).
	
	
	\maketitle
	
	% After the title page (which is a special case in that it is not numbered)
	% comes the front matter or preliminaries; this macro signals the start of
	% such content, meaning the pages are numbered with Roman numerals.
	
	\frontmatter
	
	% This macro creates the standard UoB declaration; on the printed hard-copy,
	% this must be physically signed by the author in the space indicated.
	
	\makedecl
	
	% LaTeX automatically generates a table of contents, plus associated lists 
	% of figures, tables and algorithms.  The former is a compulsory part of the
	% dissertation, but if you do not require the latter they can be suppressed
	% by simply commenting out the associated macro.
	
	\tableofcontents
	\listoffigures
	\listoftables
	\listofalgorithms
	\lstlistoflistings
	
	% The following sections are part of the front matter, but are not generated
	% automatically by LaTeX; the use of \chapter* means they are not numbered.
	
	% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	\chapter*{Abstract}

	% Finally, after the main matter, the back matter is specified.  This is
	% typically populated with just the bibliography.  LaTeX deals with these
	% in one of two ways, namely
	%
	% - inline, which roughly means the author specifies entries using the 
	%   \bibitem macro and typesets them manually, or
	% - using BiBTeX, which means entries are contained in a separate file
	%   (which is essentially a database) then imported; this is the 
	%   approach used below, with the databased being dissertation.bib.
	%
	% Either way, the each entry has a key (or identifier) which can be used
	% in the main matter to cite it, e.g., \cite{X}, \cite[Chapter 2}{Y}.
	
	\backmatter
	
	\bibliography{bibtex}
	
	% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	% The dissertation concludes with a set of (optional) appendices; these are 
	% the same as chapters in a sense, but once signalled as being appendices via
	% the associated macro, LaTeX manages them appropriately.
	
	\appendix
	
	\chapter{An Example Appendix}
	\label{appx:example}
